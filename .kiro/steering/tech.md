# Technology Stack

## Current Setup
- **AI Assistant**: Kiro with MCP integration (currently disabled)
- **IDE**: VS Code with Kiro extension
- **Platform**: Windows (win32) with cmd shell

## Development Environment
- Operating System: Windows
- Shell: Command Prompt (cmd)
- Editor: VS Code with Kiro AI assistant

## Common Commands
Since this is a minimal workspace, specific build/test commands will depend on the technology stack chosen:

### General Windows Commands
```cmd
# List files
dir

# Create directory
mkdir <directory_name>

# Remove file
del <filename>

# Copy file
copy <source> <destination>
```

### Future Considerations
When adding a specific tech stack, update this file with:
- Package managers (npm, pip, etc.)
- Build tools and scripts
- Testing frameworks
- Deployment commands
- Environment setup instructions

## Code Style Guidelines
- Follow language-specific conventions
- Use consistent indentation
- Include meaningful comments
- Maintain clean, readable code structure
