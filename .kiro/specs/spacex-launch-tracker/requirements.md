# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SpaceX Launch Tracker is a full-stack application that provides up-to-date SpaceX launch information without relying on third-party APIs. The system scrapes launch data from public sources (SpaceX website, Wikipedia, NASA pages, press kits), processes and stores it in a PostgreSQL database, exposes it via a FastAPI backend, and presents it through a Next.js frontend. The application refreshes data periodically (every 6 hours maximum) while adhering to ethical scraping practices and providing fault-tolerant operation with graceful degradation to cached data when sources are unavailable.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a space enthusiast, I want to view upcoming SpaceX launches with detailed information, so that I can stay informed about future missions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the launches page THEN the system SHALL display all upcoming launches with mission name, date, vehicle type, and payload information
2. WHEN launch data is available THEN the system SHALL show launch countdown timers for upcoming missions
3. WHEN a user clicks on a launch THEN the system SHALL navigate to a detailed view with comprehensive mission information
4. IF no upcoming launches are available THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message indicating no scheduled launches

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a space enthusiast, I want to browse historical SpaceX launches, so that I can research past missions and their outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the historical launches section THEN the system SHALL display past launches with mission outcomes and key details
2. WHEN viewing historical data THEN the system SHALL provide search and filtering capabilities by date range, mission type, and success status
3. WHEN historical launch data is displayed THEN the system SHALL include mission patches, payload details, and landing information where available
4. IF historical data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate missing information and data source limitations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the launch data to be automatically updated without manual intervention, so that I always have access to current information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scheduled refresh runs THEN the system SHALL scrape data from SpaceX website and backup sources at least twice daily
2. WHEN scraping occurs THEN the system SHALL respect robots.txt, implement rate limiting, and use randomized headers to avoid blocks
3. WHEN new data is collected THEN the system SHALL validate, deduplicate, and reconcile information from multiple sources
4. IF primary sources fail THEN the system SHALL attempt to gather data from backup sources (NASA, Wikipedia, press kits)
5. WHEN data conflicts exist between sources THEN the system SHALL prioritize SpaceX official data and flag discrepancies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to remain functional even when data sources are temporarily unavailable, so that I can still access cached launch information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN primary data sources are unavailable THEN the system SHALL serve cached data with clear timestamps indicating last update
2. WHEN scraping fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and attempt retries with exponential backoff
3. WHEN displaying cached data THEN the system SHALL prominently show the last successful refresh time
4. IF all sources fail for extended periods THEN the system SHALL maintain service using the most recent valid dataset

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search and filter launch information, so that I can quickly find specific missions or types of launches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters search terms THEN the system SHALL filter launches by mission name, payload, vehicle type, or date
2. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight matching terms and provide relevant sorting options
3. WHEN no search results are found THEN the system SHALL display helpful suggestions or alternative search terms
4. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain filter state during navigation and provide clear filter indicators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the health and performance of the scraping system, so that I can ensure data freshness and system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scraping tasks execute THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about success, failures, and data quality
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide structured error reporting with source identification and retry status
3. WHEN accessing admin features THEN the system SHALL require proper authentication and authorization
4. IF scraping performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert administrators through appropriate monitoring channels

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and work well on different devices, so that I can access launch information efficiently from any platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages load THEN the system SHALL achieve load times under 1 second for cached content
2. WHEN accessed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide responsive design with touch-friendly interfaces
3. WHEN using the API THEN the system SHALL implement caching and rate limiting to ensure consistent performance
4. IF the system experiences high load THEN the system SHALL maintain acceptable response times through proper resource management

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be maintainable and deployable, so that updates and scaling can be handled efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are made THEN the system SHALL support automated testing with >80% code coverage
2. WHEN deploying updates THEN the system SHALL use containerized deployment with Docker and CI/CD pipelines
3. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling of scraping and API components
4. IF database migrations are required THEN the system SHALL handle schema changes safely without data loss
