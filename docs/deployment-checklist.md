# Deployment Checklist

This checklist ensures all components are properly configured before deploying the SpaceX Launch Tracker.

## Pre-Deployment Setup

### 1. GitHub Repository Configuration
- [ ] Repository has `main` and `develop` branches
- [ ] All required secrets are configured (see `github-secrets-setup.md`)
- [ ] GitHub Actions is enabled for the repository
- [ ] Container registry permissions are set up

### 2. Server Infrastructure
- [ ] Staging server is provisioned and accessible
- [ ] Production server is provisioned and accessible
- [ ] Docker and Docker Compose are installed on both servers
- [ ] SSH key-based authentication is configured
- [ ] Firewall rules allow necessary ports (22, 80, 443)
- [ ] SSL certificates are configured for production domain

### 3. Database Setup
- [ ] PostgreSQL 15+ is installed and configured
- [ ] Database users and permissions are set up
- [ ] Database backups are configured
- [ ] Connection strings are tested

### 4. Cache Setup
- [ ] Redis 7+ is installed and configured
- [ ] Redis persistence is enabled
- [ ] Connection strings are tested

### 5. Domain and DNS
- [ ] Domain name is registered and configured
- [ ] DNS records point to production server
- [ ] SSL certificate is valid and auto-renewing

## Deployment Process

### 1. Initial Deployment
- [ ] Clone repository to servers
- [ ] Set up directory structure (`/opt/spacex-launch-tracker/`)
- [ ] Copy Docker Compose files to servers
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Test manual deployment with `python scripts/deploy.py`

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Testing
- [ ] Push to `develop` branch triggers staging deployment
- [ ] Staging deployment completes successfully
- [ ] All health checks pass on staging
- [ ] Smoke tests pass on staging
- [ ] Manual testing on staging environment

### 3. Production Deployment
- [ ] Merge to `main` branch triggers production deployment
- [ ] Database backup is created before deployment
- [ ] Production deployment completes successfully
- [ ] All health checks pass on production
- [ ] Smoke tests pass on production
- [ ] Manual testing on production environment

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Functional Testing
- [ ] Website loads correctly
- [ ] Launch data is displayed
- [ ] Search and filtering work
- [ ] Admin dashboard is accessible
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly

### 2. Performance Testing
- [ ] Page load times are under 1 second
- [ ] API response times are acceptable
- [ ] Database queries are optimized
- [ ] Cache hit rates are good

### 3. Security Testing
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] Authentication works correctly
- [ ] Admin endpoints require proper authorization
- [ ] No sensitive data is exposed in logs

### 4. Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Health check endpoints are monitored
- [ ] Log aggregation is working
- [ ] Error tracking is configured
- [ ] Performance metrics are collected
- [ ] Alerts are configured for critical issues

## Rollback Procedures

### 1. Automated Rollback
- [ ] Rollback triggers on deployment failure
- [ ] Previous version is restored
- [ ] Database rollback procedures are tested
- [ ] Health checks pass after rollback

### 2. Manual Rollback
- [ ] Manual rollback procedures are documented
- [ ] Database backup restoration is tested
- [ ] Rollback can be executed quickly
- [ ] Team knows how to execute rollback

## Maintenance Tasks

### 1. Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Database backups are verified daily
- [ ] Log rotation is working
- [ ] Security updates are applied
- [ ] Performance metrics are reviewed

### 2. Monitoring and Alerting
- [ ] Uptime monitoring is configured
- [ ] Error rate alerts are set up
- [ ] Performance degradation alerts are configured
- [ ] Disk space and resource alerts are active

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Deployment Fails**
   - Check GitHub Actions logs
   - Verify all secrets are configured
   - Test SSH connectivity to servers
   - Check server disk space and resources

2. **Health Checks Fail**
   - Check database connectivity
   - Verify Redis is running
   - Check Celery worker status
   - Review application logs

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Check database query performance
   - Verify cache is working
   - Monitor server resources
   - Review application metrics

4. **Security Issues**
   - Verify SSL certificates
   - Check authentication flows
   - Review access logs
   - Update security patches
